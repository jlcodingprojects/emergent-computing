A computational paradigm based around systems build out of constituent parts where the individual components act in their own self interest.

The properties of the system of a whole are emergent rather than prescribed.

Individual components should function intependently of the system as a whole. 

Components should NOT function with a concept of "Separation of concerns" or purely in the interest of their role in the greater system,
RATHER components should aim to exemplify certain independent behaviours in their own self interest.
They should interact with other parts of the system purely in that they extract the resources from around them which achieve their own goals.

This applies not to the atomic level but to emergent systems too. 

EG an emergent behaviour of a set of subsystems should use said subsystems to the extend which they help it

# IN PRACTICE EXAMPLE

A 2D simulation of a mass of cells which dynamically forms any prescribed shape.

# DESIGN PATTERNS
Decide what emergent behaviours are required and at what layers of abstraction (eg vascular system)

# CELL SYSTEMS:
A unit which has some set of behaviours.
It does need energy, but it does NOT need to metabolise. It also does NOT need to replicate. This greatly simplifies synthetic cells but still leaves incredible potential for emergent computing.

# PLAN:
Experiement with emergent computation in simulations. Try to understand the rules at play. Both in the emergent behaviours AND the most useful behaviours cells can have.
THEN theorise cells which can exist in reality. THEN apply the discovered rules to come up with emergent systems using physical cells which can solve interesting real world problems.

# REAL WORLD PROBLEMS
Most fascinating problem is growing buildings the way we grow trees.
MASSIVE scale (can make millions of houses for free)
 - Can make transportation networks
